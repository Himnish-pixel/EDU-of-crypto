# EDU-of-crypto
here i used a dataset from kaggle to analyse different cryptocurrencies, their opening values closing values highest values lowest values etc. i created a kernal density plot for all the cryptos for better visualization and used different python libraries like numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib..

if you wanna check out the graphs you have to go in the edit part as there is a small bug that may not show the graphs
