# EDU-of-crypto
here i used a dataset from kaggle to analyse different cryptocurrencies, their opening values closing values highest values lowest values etc. i created a kernal density plot for all the cryptos for better visualization and used different python libraries like numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib..

if you wanna check the graphs you have to go in edit mode or so as theres a small bug
